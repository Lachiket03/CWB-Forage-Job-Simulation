Start by determining the specific fields to include in your tables. A bank’s database, for example, might include information like account numbers, transaction dates, and transaction amounts.

Divide your information into separate tables. For a bank, one table might focus on Customers, while another focused on Transactions.

Decide which items will be stored in each table. Each item will be a column in the table. For example, a Customers table might include items like name, address, and customer ID.

Decide on each table’s primary key. This is the column that uniquely identifies each row. For a Customers table, the primary key might be the customer ID.

Define table relationships to show how one table is linked to another, and add fields if necessary. For example, a Transaction table might contain a customer ID for each row, which can then be linked back to the Customer table.
